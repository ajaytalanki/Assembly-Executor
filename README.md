This program contains an assembler that takes in an assembly file and outputs a machine hex code output file. The simulator then takes the machine hex code file as an input and displays the fetch, execude, and decode cycles of the CPU. The CPU allows 4 operations: ADD, AND, NOT, BNZ. There are four 8 bit general purpose registers R0, R1, R2, and R3. The uses of each instruction where a, b, c are general purpose registers are as follows: ADD a b c (a = b + c), AND a b c (a = b & c), NOT a b (a = ~b). The BNZ instruction is followed by a target address. The program will branch to the specified target address as long as the result of the last operation was not 0. The assembly file allows labels for jumps. The assembler starts by reading the command line arguments. If the user specifies a "-l" flag, the assembler will print out each instruction with its associated line number and machine code at the end of the file.
